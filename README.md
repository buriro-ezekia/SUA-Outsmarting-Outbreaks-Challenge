# Predictive Model for Forecasting Outbreaks of Climate-Sensitive Waterborne Diseases

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model to forecast outbreaks of climate-sensitive waterborne diseases. This model aims to assist governments, health organisations, and vulnerable communities in Tanzania by providing timely and accurate predictions of disease outbreaks, enabling proactive measures to mitigate the impact.

## Evaluation Metric
The evaluation metric used for this predictive model is the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). This metric is chosen for its straightforward interpretation of prediction accuracy, representing the average magnitude of errors in the forecasted values.

## Project Overview
Climate-sensitive waterborne diseases cause a significant threat to public health, particularly in vulnerable regions like Tanzania. By leveraging climate data and historical disease records, this project seeks to create a robust predictive model that can predict disease outbreaks with high precision.

### Key Features
- **Data Collection**: Aggregation of climate data (such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall) and historical records of waterborne disease outbreaks.
- **Feature Engineering**: Development of relevant features that capture the relationship between climate variables and disease incidence.
- **Model Training**: Utilisation of advanced machine learning algorithms to train the predictive model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessment of model performance using MAE to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **Deployment**: Implementation of the model in an accessible platform for use by stakeholders.

### Target Audience
The predictive model is designed to benefit the following groups:
- **Governments**: To inform policy decisions and allocate resources effectively to prevent and control disease outbreaks.
- **Health Organisations**: To enhance surveillance systems and improve response strategies to mitigate the spread of diseases.
- **Vulnerable Communities**: To provide early warnings and promote preventive measures to reduce the risk of disease outbreaks.
